The goal of this sample is to just use as much of the default install of Node.js as possible, and install as few additional modules as possible to make an API call and process the returned JSON.
- Creates a node server.
- Calls an API to get JSON data.
- Writes the JSON data to a .json file.
- Reads the JSON file to create an array.
- Responses to the HTTP request by sending a HTML file to the browser.
- The HTML file uses JavaScript to call an endpoint on the node server to return the created array.
- The returned data is then process using a variety of methods for handling an array.

*NOTE: This is a work in progress, and I will be adding more functionality when I have time.*
